# Build Home Lab - SOC Automation

## Objective


The Home Lab Project is a mini virtual environment that simulates the work environment of the Security Operations Center and is helpful to understand the work in cybersecurity. We enable attack simulations such as malware attacks, phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities, incident response, and log analysis.

### Skills Learned
